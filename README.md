# measurement_simulability
This repository contains Matlab code that accompanys the paper: Strict hierarchy between n-wise measurement simulability, compatibility structures, and multi-copy compatibility (arXiv:XXXX.YYYYY) by L. Tendick, C. Budroni, and M.T Quintino. If you use any of the codes for academic research, please cite this paper. If you have any questions about the codes, comments, etc., feel free to contact me: lucas-amadeus.tendick@inria.fr.

The codes make use of functions from the QETLAB package (https://qetlab.com/, https://github.com/nathanieljohnston/QETLAB) and functions from the steerinreview package (https://github.com/paulskrzypczyk/steeringreview, https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6633/80/2/024001) which are also included here, with their respective README and license files.
